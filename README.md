# Kolton Brockhouse: Securing the Digital World 🌎

Hi, I'm Kolton! Welcome to my cybersecurity project space.

I love cybersecurity because it lets me dive into tough challenges and build real, hands-on solutions to make things more secure. It's all about making digital systems stronger and safer.

This portfolio shows off what I've been working on. Take a look around and see how I put cybersecurity ideas into action!

## 🔍 Finding & Fixing Security Weaknesses

Here's how I work to find and fix security holes, making systems resilient:

-   **[Vulnerability Management Program Implementation](https://github.com/koltonbrockhouse/vulnerability-management-program)**: This project shows how I build and run a complete program to manage vulnerabilities—from finding them to making sure they're patched up.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Hunting Down Cyber Threats

I also love tracking down sneaky cyber threats before they cause trouble:

-   **[Threat Hunting Scenario (TOR Browser)](https://github.com/koltonbrockhouse/threat-hunting-senario-tor)**: This is a hands-on example where I investigated suspicious network activity, specifically how to detect and analyze hidden Tor browser usage to stop potential attacks.
